Hence this repository will keep all of us on the same page.

# Referencing Template
This is some text that I want to relate with some reference / ref source. Since the refs have to be managed in Harvard style and they should be consistent throughout the document, we will arrange or add all the refernces once done with writting paper content. So for now use this flag/ style to indicate a refernce. *(Has_Ref#1)*

// In the end of document, append your references in the list like this  
Mohsin_ref#1: --SomeUrlHere--
Mohsin_ref#2: --SomeUrlHere--
Mohsin_ref#3: --SomeUrlHere--
Saleh_ref#1: --SomeUrlHere--
Saleh_ref#2: --SomeUrlHere--
Saad_ref#1: --SomeUrlHere--
Saad_ref#1: --SomeUrlHere--
*Has_ref#1: --SomeUrlHere--* // My ref to paragraph added.
